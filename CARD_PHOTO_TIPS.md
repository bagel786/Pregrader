# Tips for Taking Good Card Photos

To get accurate grading results, the AI needs clear, well-lit photos of your Pokemon cards. Here's how to take the best photos:

## ✅ DO

### Lighting
- **Use natural daylight** or bright indoor lighting
- **Avoid direct sunlight** - it creates harsh shadows and glare
- **Use diffused light** - near a window with curtains is ideal
- **Light from multiple angles** to reduce shadows

### Card Position
- **Fill the frame** - card should take up 70-80% of the photo
- **Keep card flat** - use a flat surface, not holding in hand
- **Center the card** - all four corners should be visible
- **Straight angle** - camera directly above the card (90° angle)
- **Show all edges** - don't crop any part of the card

### Camera Settings
- **Focus on the card** - tap the card on screen to focus
- **Hold steady** - use both hands or a tripod
- **Good resolution** - use main camera, not front camera
- **Clean lens** - wipe your camera lens before shooting

### Background
- **Use a plain background** - white, black, or solid color
- **Avoid patterns** - no wood grain, fabric texture, etc.
- **Matte surface** - not glossy or reflective
- **Contrasting color** - dark background for light cards, light for dark cards

## ❌ DON'T

### Lighting Issues
- ❌ Don't use flash - creates harsh glare
- ❌ Don't shoot in dim lighting - causes blur
- ❌ Don't have light source behind the card - creates shadows
- ❌ Don't shoot under colored lights - affects color accuracy

### Card Position Issues
- ❌ Don't hold card in hand - causes shake and angle issues
- ❌ Don't shoot at an angle - makes centering analysis inaccurate
- ❌ Don't crop corners - AI needs to see full card edges
- ❌ Don't have card too small in frame - reduces detail
- ❌ Don't have card too close - may cut off edges

### Quality Issues
- ❌ Don't use blurry photos - AI can't detect edges
- ❌ Don't use photos with glare - obscures surface details
- ❌ Don't use photos with shadows - affects corner analysis
- ❌ Don't use photos with reflections - interferes with detection

## 📸 Step-by-Step Guide

### Setup (30 seconds)
1. Find a flat surface near a window
2. Place a white or black sheet of paper as background
3. Place your card in the center
4. Position yourself so light comes from the side, not behind you

### Taking the Photo (10 seconds)
1. Hold phone directly above card (not at an angle)
2. Ensure all four corners are visible in frame
3. Tap on the card to focus
4. Hold steady and take the photo
5. Review - if blurry or glare visible, retake

### Both Sides
- Take front photo first
- Carefully flip the card
- Take back photo with same setup
- Keep lighting and angle consistent

## 🎯 Perfect Photo Checklist

Before submitting, verify your photo has:

- [ ] All four corners visible
- [ ] Card fills 70-80% of frame
- [ ] No glare or reflections
- [ ] No shadows on the card
- [ ] Card is in focus (not blurry)
- [ ] Plain background (no patterns)
- [ ] Good lighting (not too dark or bright)
- [ ] Straight angle (not tilted)
- [ ] Clean edges visible
- [ ] Colors look accurate

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Card not detected"
**Cause:** Card edges not visible or too much background
**Solution:** 
- Move camera closer
- Ensure all corners are in frame
- Use contrasting background

### Issue: "Inner artwork frame not detected"
**Cause:** Glare, blur, or poor contrast
**Solution:**
- Reduce glare by adjusting light angle
- Ensure photo is in focus
- Use better lighting

### Issue: Inaccurate centering score
**Cause:** Photo taken at an angle
**Solution:**
- Hold camera directly above card (90° angle)
- Use a level surface
- Keep card flat

### Issue: Inaccurate corner/edge scores
**Cause:** Shadows, blur, or glare on edges
**Solution:**
- Use diffused lighting from multiple angles
- Ensure edges are in focus
- Avoid shadows on card edges

## 📱 App Camera Tips

When using the in-app camera:

1. **Use the overlay guide** - align card with the rectangle
2. **Wait for focus** - camera will auto-focus on the card
3. **Hold steady** - keep phone still for 1-2 seconds
4. **Review before confirming** - check for blur or glare
5. **Retake if needed** - don't settle for a bad photo

## 🌟 Pro Tips

### For Holographic/Foil Cards
- Angle light to minimize glare
- May need to take multiple photos to find best angle
- Slight tilt (5-10°) can help reduce glare
- Use polarizing filter if available

### For Dark Cards
- Use white background for better contrast
- Increase lighting slightly
- Ensure edges are clearly visible

### For Valuable Cards
- Use card sleeve for protection
- Ensure sleeve is clean and scratch-free
- Avoid glare from sleeve surface
- Consider removing from sleeve if safe

### For Damaged Cards
- Ensure damage is clearly visible
- Good lighting helps AI detect wear
- Don't try to hide damage - it affects grading
- Multiple angles may help for severe damage

## 📊 Example Comparisons
